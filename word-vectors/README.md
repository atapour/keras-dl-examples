This notebook will provide a simple example that loads pre-trained word embeddings (Word2Vec) and performs a few arithmetic operations.

This is a code demonstration for CSC8637: Deep Learning module, Lecture 09: Time-Series Data: Natural Language Processing.

In this code demonstration, we would like to explore the capabilities of Word2Vec. We will download the Word2Vec model trained on part of the Google News dataset, covering approximately 3 million words and phrases. We take advantage of the [Gensim library](https://pypi.org/project/gensim/), which is used for unsupervised topic modelling and other natural language processing tasks.

A larger live demo, trained on the entire Google News dataset, can be found here: [https://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-tutorial/#app](https://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-tutorial/#app)

To run the code, please follow the detailed instructions in the `.ipynb` file or the comments in `.py` file.
