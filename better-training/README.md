# Keras code to demonstrate better training of neural networks using CIFAR-10

## Author : Amir Atapour-Abarghouei, amir.atapour-abarghouei@newcastle.ac.uk

This notebook will provide an example to show how data augmentation and transfer learning can improve the performance of neural networks and prevent overfitting using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

This is a code demonstration for CSC8637: Deep Learning module, Lecture 10: Better Training of Neural Networks.

In this code demonstration, the effects of over-fitting are demonstrated by training a CNN on a small amount of data and then possible solutions are explored.

To run the code, please follow the detailed instructions in the `.ipynb` file or the comments in `.py` file.
