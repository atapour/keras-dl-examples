# Keras Code for Visualising Activation Maps

## Author : Amir Atapour-Abarghouei, amir.atapour-abarghouei@newcastle.ac.uk

This notebook will provide an example for visualising activation maps from different blocks of a VGG-16.

This is a code demonstration for CSC8637: Deep Learning module, Lecture 12: Ethics and Challenges.

In this code demonstration, activation maps from different layers of a VGG-16 network trained on ImageNet are visualised. The same process can of course be done for architectures other than VGG-16.

To run the code, please follow the detailed instructions in the `.ipynb` file or the comments in `.py` file.
